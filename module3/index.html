    <p>  <strong> Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy <em> text of the printing</em> and typesetting industry. <mark >Lorem Ipsum</mark> has been the industry's standard dummy text<sup>ever since </sup> the 1500s, when an<sub>unknown </sub> printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        <br> <hr> It has survived <b>not only five </b>centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <i>It was popularised</i> in the 1960s<small>with the release </small> of Letraset sheets containing <del>Lorem Ipsum </del>passages, and more recently <ins>with desktop</ins> publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
